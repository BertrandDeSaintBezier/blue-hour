# Blue Hour

The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of computer graphics using a barebones C-approach.

Based on Pikuma's excellent course on graphics programming, the goal is to build upon those lessons and practice what I've learned in a very hands-off manner (*aka not directly following along and/or copying code*).



Blue hour aims to be first and foremost a playground to learn C and hone computer graphics skills. There is no clearly defined output, simply programming for the joy of it :)



Feel free to look around.
